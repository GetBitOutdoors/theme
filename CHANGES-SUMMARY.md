# ClojureScript Integration Changes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate ClojureScript into the BigCommerce Stencil theme using the ESM module approach with shadow-cljs and webpack.

## Key Changes

### 1. Shadow-CLJS Configuration

- Updated `shadow-cljs.edn` to use `:target :esm` instead of `:target :browser`
- Added `:js-options {:js-provider :import}` for proper ESM module generation
- Removed `:asset-path` which is not needed with ESM target
- Maintained module splitting for main, product, cart, and category

### 2. Webpack Integration

- Enhanced `webpack.shadow.js` with ESM module support:
  - Added `experiments: { outputModule: true }`
  - Configured proper module resolution paths
  - Improved source map handling
- Updated `webpack.common.js` to include ClojureScript loader

### 3. JavaScript Loader

- Completely rewrote `assets/js/cljs-loader.js` to use ESM imports:
  - Implemented dynamic imports for ClojureScript modules
  - Created a module cache to avoid redundant imports
  - Used async/await for proper module loading sequence
  - Added error handling for module loading failures

### 4. Development Environment

- Updated `stencil.conf.cjs` with proxy configuration for shadow-cljs dev server
- Created `start-dev.sh` script to run both shadow-cljs and stencil servers concurrently
- Added pre-commit hook for automatic ClojureScript verification

### 5. UI Components

- Added CSS styles for ClojureScript components in `assets/scss/components/cljs/_cljs-components.scss`
- Updated `theme.scss` to import the new component styles
- Modified BigCommerce templates to include ClojureScript component containers:
  - Added product widget to `product.html`
  - Added cart summary to `cart.html`
  - Added category view to `category.html`

### 6. Code Quality

- Fixed lint errors in ClojureScript files
- Removed unused imports in `category.cljs`
- Verified all ClojureScript code with clj-kondo

### 7. Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation in `CLOJURESCRIPT.md`
- Added detailed instructions for development workflow
- Included troubleshooting tips

## Development Workflow

The new development workflow is streamlined:

1. Run `./start-dev.sh` to start both shadow-cljs and stencil servers
2. Edit ClojureScript files in `src/cljs/gbo/`
3. Changes are automatically compiled and hot-reloaded

## Build Process

For production builds:

1. Run `npm run build:all` to compile ClojureScript with advanced optimizations and build the Webpack production bundle
2. The output is ready for deployment to BigCommerce

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more ClojureScript components as needed
- Explore more advanced ClojureScript features like re-frame or reagent
- Optimize bundle sizes further if needed
